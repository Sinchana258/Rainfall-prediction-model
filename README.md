#  Rainfall Prediction using Machine Learning  

##  Project Overview  
This project predicts **daily and annual rainfall** for Udupi district using **historical NASA POWER weather data (1990â€“2024)**.  
We implemented **Random Forest** and **Gradient Boosting** models to capture rainfall patterns and trends.  

The system helps in **agriculture planning, water resource management, and climate studies** by providing accurate rainfall forecasts.

##  Features  
-  **Data Preprocessing** â†’ Handles missing values & outliers using IQR and capping  
-  **Feature Engineering** â†’ Extracts seasonal & climatic features (temperature, humidity, soil wetness, wind, etc.)  
-  **Random Forest** â†’ Handles non-linear weather relationships  
-  **Gradient Boosting** â†’ Improves prediction accuracy through boosting  
-  **Evaluation Metrics** â†’ RMSE & RÂ² Score  
-  **Daily & Annual Predictions** â†’ Can predict rainfall for any given date or year

##  Model Performance  

| Model             | Train RÂ² | Test RÂ² | Train RMSE | Test RMSE |
|-------------------|----------|---------|------------|-----------|
| Random Forest     | 0.97     | 0.76    | 86.69      | 159.60    |
| Gradient Boosting | 0.999    | 0.74    | 0.636      | 166.51    |

âœ… Gradient Boosting performed best overall, especially for capturing monsoon trends.
